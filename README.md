# How to avoid rats :
- Use recaf tools to check for any suspicious string like :
- **Webhhooks** "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/"
- **Website** such as "http://checkip.amazonaws.com" and "https://whatismyaddress.net/" which can be used to log your ip
- **Encryption** i usually use advanced encryption for my string so it isn't detected as malicious as for they are decoded inside the client
- **Trust** Never trust a random person or random jar, a life is worth more than a program

## QnA
<h3>Am i allowed to include this repo/jar in one of my video/tierlist/archive 
<p>No, i don't want it to be spread and if you do, i would likely suggest a DMCA request</p>
<h3>Does this jar contains rat since you spoke about it?</h2>
<p>No, if it did, that would mean the jar had been used for something it wasnâ€™t intended for.</p>
<h3> Why writing this if the jar is safe?</h2>
<p>To simply warn about the usage of a unsafe .jar</p>
